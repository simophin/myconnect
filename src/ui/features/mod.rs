//! Each feature's UI: its actions and status on a device, its page, what
//! it does with dropped files, its settings and its demo data. [`Features`]
//! is the one place that lists them: the shell calls it, and it calls each
//! feature by name.
//!
//! Adding a feature means a module here, a [`Feature`] variant if it has
//! messages, and a line in each function of [`Features`] that applies.
