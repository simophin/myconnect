//! Transfers: the core service every feature that moves a file builds on
//! (sharing, browsing a device's files).
//!
//! A feature starts a transfer with [`Transfers::begin`] and gets a
//! [`TransferHandle`]. The handle owns the transfer's state machine: it
//! moves it through `connecting` and `transferring`, records progress
//! (publishing at most one `transfer.progress` event per
//! [`PROGRESS_EVENT_INTERVAL`]), and ends it as completed, failed or
//! cancelled. A handle dropped before it ends the transfer fails it (or
//! cancels it, if cancellation was asked for), so a task that panics or is
//! aborted never leaves a transfer running. The core lists transfers
//! (`GET /transfers`), cancels them (`DELETE /transfers/{id}`, a device
//! disconnecting), and waits for their tasks at shutdown.
//!
//! This module also has the pure helpers: destination filename
//! sanitization and collision-avoiding naming, kept free of sockets and
//! state so path sanitization can be tested in isolation.
