/**
 * @file handle_table.h
 * @brief Generational handle table backing every C ABI object handle.
 *
 * The ownership rules this implements are specified in the libnativeapi
 * workspace repo (specs/handle-ownership.md).
 *
 * A handle is an opaque 64-bit integer, never a pointer:
 *
 *     [ generation : 32 | slot index : 32 ]
 *
 * Resolving one checks three things — that the slot exists, that its generation
 * still matches, and that its type tag is the type the caller expects. Releasing
 * a handle clears the slot and bumps its generation, which invalidates every
 * outstanding handle to that slot at once.
 *
 * Why this shape:
 *
 *  - Handles cross into Dart and Swift, where finalizers run at unpredictable
 *    times. With raw pointers, use-after-free and double-free are a matter of
 *    when, not if. Here a stale handle fails a comparison instead of
 *    dereferencing freed memory.
 *  - The type tag turns handle confusion (passing a menu handle to a window
 *    function) from undefined behaviour into a clean error.
 *  - The table owns a shared_ptr, so Resolve() can hand back a strong reference
 *    that keeps the object alive for the duration of the call. That is what
 *    finally lets std::shared_ptr-based APIs cross the C ABI at all — the single
 *    biggest blocker on codegen coverage.
