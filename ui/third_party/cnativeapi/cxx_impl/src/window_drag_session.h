/**
 * @brief Tracks a pointer drag globally and, optionally, moves a window with it.
 *
 * This is the building block for tear-off tabs and dockable panels: a drag
 * that begins inside one window has to keep going after its content moves to a
 * different window, which the originating window's own mouse events cannot
 * describe. A session follows the primary mouse button across the whole
 * screen, independent of which window receives mouse events, until the button
 * is released.
 *
 * Typical tear-off flow:
 * 1. On mouse-down inside window A, `Start(nullptr, {})` to follow the cursor
 *    without moving anything; watch WindowDragMovedEvent for the cursor
 *    leaving the region the content may be dragged within.
 * 2. When it does, create window B for the content and call
 *    `Start(window_b, anchor)` on the same session. The session hands over
 *    without emitting an end event, and window B now tracks the cursor.
 * 3. While moving, use WindowManager::GetWindowAtPoint() with window B
 *    excluded to find what is under the cursor and highlight drop targets.
 * 4. On WindowDragEndedEvent, either leave window B where it is or move the
 *    content back into the window it was dropped on.
 *
 * Events are emitted synchronously on the main thread. Listeners may call
 * Start() or Cancel() from inside a callback.
 *
 * Platform notes:
 * - macOS, Windows, and Linux (X11) are supported. On Wayland the global cursor
 *   position is not available to applications, so sessions end immediately.
 * - Android, iOS, and OpenHarmony do not support sessions; Start() returns false.
 * - On Windows, positions follow the library-wide convention of physical pixels
 *   divided by the scale factor of the monitor they fall on. The window is
 *   moved in physical pixels internally, so it stays glued to the cursor when
 *   it crosses monitors with different scale factors.
