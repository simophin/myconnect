/**
 * @brief TrayIcon represents a system tray icon (notification area icon).
 *
 * This class provides a cross-platform interface for creating and managing
 * system tray icons. System tray icons appear in the notification area of
 * the desktop and provide quick access to application functionality through
 * context menus and click events.
 *
 * The class supports:
 * - Setting custom icons (including base64-encoded images)
 * - Displaying text titles and tooltips
 * - Context menus for user interaction
 * - Event emission for mouse clicks (TrayIconClickedEvent,
 * TrayIconRightClickedEvent, TrayIconDoubleClickedEvent)
 * - Visibility control
 *
 * @note This class uses the PIMPL idiom to hide platform-specific
 * implementation details and ensure binary compatibility across different
 * platforms.
 *
 * @example
 * ```cpp
 * // Create a tray icon
 * auto tray_icon = std::make_shared<TrayIcon>();
 * tray_icon->SetIcon("path/to/icon.png");
 * tray_icon->SetTooltip("My Application");
 *
 * // Set up event listeners
 * tray_icon->AddListener<TrayIconClickedEvent>([](const TrayIconClickedEvent&
 * event) {
 *     // Handle left click - show/hide main window

 * TrayIconRightClickedEvent& event) {
