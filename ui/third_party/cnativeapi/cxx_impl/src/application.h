 * @brief Application is a singleton class that manages the application lifecycle

 * The Application class provides centralized management of application-wide state,

 * singleton pattern to ensure there's only one application instance throughout
 * the application lifetime.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Singleton pattern ensures single application instance
 * - Event-driven architecture for application lifecycle notifications
 * - Cross-platform application management
 * - Integration with existing managers (WindowManager, DisplayManager, etc.)
 * - Thread-safe access to the singleton instance
 * - Automatic cleanup of resources on destruction
 *
 * @note This class is thread-safe for singleton access, but individual operations
 *       may require additional synchronization depending on the platform implementation.
