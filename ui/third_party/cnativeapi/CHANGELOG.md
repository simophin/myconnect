## 0.3.0

* **Breaking:** requires Flutter 3.47 / Dart 3.13.
* Android: the shared library is linked with 16 KB page alignment, so it loads on the
  Android 15 devices that use 16 KB memory pages.
* Linux: building no longer asks for `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`. The tray icon has been a
  StatusNotifierItem over D-Bus for a while; only the plugin's CMake file still required
  and linked the library.
* Update the embedded core: a translucent window background is see-through on Windows and
  Linux, `native_window_set_has_shadow` works on Linux, Linux hides GTK's header bar for
  `titleBarStyle = hidden` instead of un-decorating the window, and a Linux window's
  content size is measured without the shadow margin.

## 0.2.7

* Same as 0.2.6; released together with nativeapi 0.2.7 (there is no nativeapi 0.2.6).

## 0.2.6

* Update the embedded core and regenerate the C bindings.
* Add `native_tray_icon_set_icon_template` / `_is_icon_template`, `_set_icon_size` /
  `_get_icon_size`, `_set_icon_position` / `_get_icon_position` and
  `native_tray_icon_position_t`. macOS no longer forces tray icons to be template images.
* Add `native_window_set_parent_window` / `native_window_get_parent_window`, and the
  `NATIVE_WINDOW_EVENT_TYPE_CREATED` / `_CLOSED` window events.
* macOS: a window background color with alpha makes the window non-opaque.
* Windows: tray icons are added again when Explorer restarts; menu item clicks are emitted
  before the popup call returns, and its result says whether the menu was shown.
* Linux: one D-Bus connection per tray icon; window geometry measured by frame and content.
* Fix window handlers being called for menus that were already destroyed.

## 0.2.5

* Update the embedded core and regenerate the C bindings.
* Add `native_drag_source_*`, `native_drop_target_*` and `native_window_drag_session_*`
  for dragging files and text in and out of windows and for tear-off window drags, plus
  `native_window_manager_get_window_at_point`.
* Add `native_window_set_visible_in_taskbar` / `native_window_is_visible_in_taskbar`.
* Emit the window resized, moved, minimized, maximized and restored events, which the
  ABI declared the whole way through but never dispatched.
* Windows: track full screen as window state instead of comparing rectangles, fix
  `native_window_set_has_shadow`, the hidden title bar style, `native_window_is_minimized`,
  window hit testing and late drag starts, submenu detach/reattach and Top End placement.
* Linux: fix `native_window_manager_get_current` and `native_window_is_focused`,
  implement `native_window_start_dragging`, keep the application running instead of
  exiting at once, stop crashing on window-relative context menus, and survive monitors
  being replaced.
* macOS: keep the mouse gesture after a native window drag or resize starts.

## 0.2.4

* Windows: compile the C API directly into the plugin DLL to retain exported entry points.
* Compile Apple core sources as separate translation units to avoid duplicate definitions.
* Update the embedded core and generated C bindings.

## 0.2.3

* Add `native_window_set_non_activating` / `native_window_is_non_activating`
* macOS: `native_window_set_focusable` is now implemented (it was a no-op)

## 0.2.2

* Fix macOS build failure in 0.2.1: `redefinition of 'ToStdString'`. The macOS unity
  build compiles every platform `.mm` into one translation unit, and `app_info`,
  `device_info` and `launch_at_login` each defined that helper privately

## 0.2.1

* Update `cxx_impl` to core 5a5afc7
* Add `AppInfo` C bindings (name, identifier, version, build number)
* Add `DeviceInfo` C bindings (name, model, manufacturer, OS, kernel, architecture)
* Fix window focused/blurred events never being dispatched on macOS, Windows and Linux

## 0.2.0

* Regenerate the complete C bindings from the new code generator
* Unify the object identity/lifecycle model with a generational handle table
* Fix tray icon bounds on multi-display setups (macOS)
* Fix macOS global shortcuts never firing
* Rewrite EventEmitter locking and dispatch; add a main-thread dispatcher
* Add `UrlOpener` CanOpen support
* Require C++17 and propagate the requirement to consumers
* Remove the obsolete Python bindgen tooling

## 0.1.4

* Fix macOS menu item disabled state not being respected
* Fix Windows window `SetMinimumSize`/`SetMaximumSize` not working
* Add per-monitor DPI scaling for Windows display and window geometry
* Track menu item enabled state and update flags on Windows
* Adjust Linux tray icon menu trigger handling

## 0.1.3

* Remove duplicate macOS deployment target build setting from the podspec
* Update storage example Darwin integration to use Swift Package Manager

## 0.1.2

* Add LaunchAtLogin C bindings

## 0.1.1

* Add multi-platform FFI C bindings (Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows)
* Migrate iOS and macOS native bindings to SwiftPM
* Add UrlOpener C bindings
* Add autostart and global shortcuts C bindings
* Add window visual effects and color C bindings
* Add title bar style and control button C bindings
* Introduce bindgen code generation toolchain

## 0.1.0

* Initial release
