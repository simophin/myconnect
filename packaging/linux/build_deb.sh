# APP is cargo's ferry-gui, installed under that name as /usr/bin/ferry-gui;
# CLI is cargo's ferry-cli, the command line, installed next to it as
# /usr/bin/ferry-cli (docs/adr/0001, "Packaging"). LICENSES is the
# THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.html cargo-about wrote (about.toml), installed in
# /usr/share/doc/ferry.
# The menu entry, in each of the app's languages (packaging/i18n.sh), and
# the icons go to /usr/share. Runs on Debian or
# Ubuntu: it needs dpkg-deb, and dpkg-shlibdeps to work out the dependencies
# from the ELF files. Build on the oldest release you want to support, since
# the glibc it links against is the oldest one the package will install on.

Description: Pair with your devices and share files and the clipboard
 Ferry connects your computer with your phone and other devices on the
 local network, using the KDE Connect protocol: send files, share the
 clipboard and ping devices you have paired with. It comes with the
 ferry-cli command line, which drives the app once its Command line
 access setting is on.
