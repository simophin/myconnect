# a DMG.
#
#   build_app.sh VERSION BUILD DMG LICENSES RELEASE_DIR...
#
# Each RELEASE_DIR is cargo's release directory for one architecture (e.g.
# target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release), holding ferry-gui and ferry-cli; with
# more than one, lipo joins each into a universal binary. The app is
# Contents/MacOS/Ferry and the CLI Contents/MacOS/ferry-cli, which users
# link onto their PATH. LICENSES is the THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.html
# cargo-about wrote (about.toml), which goes in Resources. VERSION is
# MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (macOS accepts nothing else) and BUILD a number. Writes
# the DMG, and leaves Ferry.app next to it. Needs macOS: lipo, iconutil,
# codesign and hdiutil. Each of the app's languages gets a <lang>.lproj in
# Resources, from its i18n/<lang>/ferry.ftl (packaging/i18n.sh).
#
# The bundle is ad-hoc signed and not sandboxed (docs/adr/0001,
# "Deliberate differences"): Gatekeeper blocks it until the user allows it in
# System Settings → Privacy & Security.
